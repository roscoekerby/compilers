Honours Compilers Module 

Small Compiler Project written in Python using PLY


Build a lexer, whose file is called lexer.py, that recognises the tokens of a simple adder
as one may encounter in a programming language.

Build a parser for the lexer youâ€™ve created in the previous task, and save it in a
file called parser.py.

Automatically calculate how many atoms a molecule has, given as input some arbitrary molecular formula in a file called molecule.py.
